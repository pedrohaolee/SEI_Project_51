## Introduction

_Sudoku_ is a popular number puzzle game that tests logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The game consists of a 9x9 grid, which is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, also known as regions or boxes. The objective of Sudoku is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following these simple rules:

- Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.
- Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.
- Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.

The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, providing clues that guide the player towards the solution. A well-designed Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution, which can be reached through logical deduction rather than guesswork.

## Game Play

Upon starting the game, the player is prompted to select a difficulty level.

Once the level is chosen, the game begins.

If the player enters an incorrect number into the board, the cell will turn red and the mistake counter will increase by one.

Conversely, when the correct number is entered, a celebratory firework animation will display on the screen.

## Code structure explanation

`rowSafe()`,`colSafe()` and `boxSafe()` are three functions that check if the three _Sudoku_ rules are followed.

`gridSafe()` checks if all three rules are all met.

`nextCell()` finds the location of the next unfilled cell.

`solveSudoku()` generate a 9x9 matrix that follows the _sudoku_ rules.

`startGamePlay()` starts the game, after receiving two variables `holeNum` and `timeLimit` from the event listener, depending on which button is clicked.

## Introduction

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that tests logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The game consists of a 9x9 grid, which is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, also known as regions or boxes. The objective of Sudoku is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following these simple rules:

- Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.
- Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.
- Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition.

The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, providing clues that guide the player towards the solution. A well-designed Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution, which can be reached through logical deduction rather than guesswork.
